- Data-Driven Insights: Leverage insights to inform strategic decisions and enhance sales strategies

## Problem Statement
In today's competitive automotive market, real-time insights into sales performance are critical for effective decision-making and strategic planning. Our current systems lack the capability to efficiently track and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs), hindering our ability to respond to market trends and growth opportunities

### Objective 
The goal is to develop a comprehensive dashboard that provides real-time insights into critical sales metrics. This dashboard will empower stakeholders to monitor performance, identify trends, and make informed decisions that drive growth.

### Requirements
#### 1. KPI Tracking:
- The dashboard must display essential sales metrics, including Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) total sales, average price analysis, and cars sold metrics. Additionally, comparisons with previous year-to-date figures will be essential to gauge growth and performance.

#### 2. Data Visualization: 
- Effective visualization of data is crucial. The dashboard should incorporate various charts, such as:
  - A line chart to illustrate the weekly trend of YTD sales.
  - Pie charts to show the distribution of sales by body style and color.
  - A map chart to visualize sales data by dealer region.
  - A grid format for company-wise sales trends and a detailed grid presenting all relevant information for each car sale.

### Outcomes
- By implementing this dashboard, we aim to enhance our ability to monitor sales performance, identify growth opportunities, and make strategic decisions that contribute to the overall success of our organization.
